xml htmlize
==========

Rails helper to XHTML-ize chunks of user submitted HTML. For the standardista in all of us.

>> html = "<div><p>foo</p><a href='http://foo.com'>foo"
=> "<div><p>foo</p><a href='http://foo.com'>foo"
>> xhtmlize(html)
=> "<div><p>foo</p><a href=\"http://foo.com\">foo</a></div>"

Also comes with an ActiveRecord class method to automatically xhtmlize attributes in an after_save callback.

class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  xhtmlize :title, :content
End
